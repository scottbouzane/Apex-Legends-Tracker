- Style using Flexbox 
- Use Axios to make a request with Apex API
- Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint
- Deploy site to github pages
- Make commits to github daily


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second Apex API
- Style with more CSS 
- Add onto responsive design 

## Project Schedule

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
